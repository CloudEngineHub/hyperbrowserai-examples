- Recent commits and changes
- Issues and pull requests
- Documentation content
- Installation and setup instructions
- Code functionality and features

## Technical Details

- **Web Scraping**: Uses Hyperbrowser SDK for intelligent GitHub scraping
- **AI Processing**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for natural language processing
- **Data Extraction**: Focuses on markdown content, file structures, and repository metadata
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with readline-sync for seamless command-line interaction

## Limitations

- Requires valid API keys for both Hyperbrowser and OpenAI
- Scraping large repositories may take some time
- Responses are based on publicly available repository information
- Rate limits may apply based on your API plan

## Troubleshooting

**Scraping failed error**: 
- Ensure the GitHub URL is valid and publicly accessible
- Check your Hyperbrowser API key is correct

**OpenAI errors**:
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

**TypeScript compilation errors**:
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
